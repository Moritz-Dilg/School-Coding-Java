/** Simple input from the keyboard or from a file.
<p>This class allows reading formatted data either from the keyboard
or from a file. It is intended to be used in an introductory
programming course when classes, packages and exceptions are unknown
at the beginning. To use it, simply copy In.class into the
source file directory. </p>

<p>All input comes from the current input file, which is initially
the keyboard. Opening a file with open() makes it the new current
input file. Closing a file with close() switches back to the previous
input file.</p>

<p>When reading from the keyboard, reading blocks until the user has entered
a sequence of characters terminated by the return key. All methods read
from this input buffer (including the terminating '\r' and '\n') until the
buffer is fully consumed. When a method tries to read beyond the end
of the buffer, it blocks again waiting for the next buffer.</p>

<p>End of file detection: When reading from the keyboard, eof can be
signaled as ctrl-Z at the beginning of a new line. When reading from a file,
eof occurs when an attempt is made to read beyond the end of the file.
In either case In.done() returns false if the requested data could not
be read because of eof. </p>
